# GameCenter <br/>
This is a game center developed in Java. The game center consists of clickgame, Roll a dice and snakes and ladders. <br/>
**Click game:** <br/>
Here the point is to get as many clicks as possible in 60 seconds. The record will be saved to a file called 'record.txt'. <br/>
**Roll a dice:** <br/>
This is a two player game where the point is to roll dices 3, 5 or 7 turns. The player that gets the highest total score wins. <br/>
**Snake and ladders** <br/>
This is a two player game where the winner will be the one that gets to the top right square first. The road to this square could be hard or easy, because the board consists of both snakes and ladders. If a player land on a snake the player will go down to the end of the snake, and if a player lands on a ladder the player will climb to the top of the ladder. <br/>
**How to play** <br/>
The game center is runned from the main.java file inside the RollADice folder. From here the user have the choice between the two games. Click game and Roll a dice is pretty straightforward to play. In Snakes and ladders the players have to press the 'new game' button first. From here a popup 'set up game' will appear where the players can set up their nicknames and colours for their pieces. After the players have clicked 'OK' the game can start. If one player lands on a snake or a ladder the player have to click where they landed (head of the snake or start of the ladder) to continue the game.
